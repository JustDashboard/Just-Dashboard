# Automatic recipes and serving defaults

`just-dashboard-recipes-v2` prepares immutable Dockerfiles using digest-pinned catalogue bases. Build
commands execute inside the build container; source inspection never executes repository configuration
on the host. Generated Dockerfiles use root-relative, exclusive writes so a checkout symlink cannot
redirect output outside the build context. Detection ignores this generated directory.

## Build values

Every `build`-scoped variable automatically reaches the recipe's build command through a required
BuildKit environment secret mount. Frozen run inputs supply the names at preparation and values at
build time; the bindings must agree. A variable's explicit `build.secrets` mapping to `install` limits
it to dependency installation instead. Build settings expose this choice for each build-scoped value.
Runtime and release-task scopes remain separate. Custom Dockerfiles do not gain automatic values or
secret mappings; they retain their existing refusal of requested secrets.

Neither generated Dockerfiles nor command arguments contain variable values. Logs redact exact values.
An ephemeral mount does not prevent application build code from intentionally copying a value into its
output. In particular, Next.js `NEXT_PUBLIC_` values and Vite `VITE_` values embedded in browser assets
are public, even if encrypted in the dashboard. Quick setup and the variable editor explain this.
See the upstream [Next.js environment contract](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)
and [Vite environment contract](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode).

## JavaScript and static output

The lockfile selects npm, pnpm, Yarn or Bun. When lockfiles for more than one manager are committed,
the build setting `packageManager` chooses, then `packageManager` in `package.json`; with neither, the
recipe and preflight refuse rather than install from a lockfile the project may have abandoned. A chosen
manager must have its own lockfile. Plain HTML uses the selected source directory as
its public root; its output directory is empty, not the source directory repeated a second time.
Packaged static output always serves on nginx port 80, regardless of a repository's development/start
script port. Quick setup and the wizard generate required HTTP readiness checks for that serving port.

SvelteKit detection precedes generic Vite detection. Exactly one of `adapter-node` and `adapter-static`
must be declared for the automatic recipe. `adapter-node` defaults to `node build` (Bun:
`bun ./build/index.js`) on port 3000 and checks the conventional generated server entrypoint after build.
`adapter-static` packages `build/` on port 80. Custom output paths must match the configured start command
or static output; missing output fails the build before activation. An absent/ambiguous/provider adapter
is a planning blocker with a Dockerfile escape hatch. Inspection does not evaluate `svelte.config.js`.
Upstream contracts: [Node adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node),
[static adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static).

Detection preserves an actual Dockerfile/Containerfile filename relative to its build root. A single
literal TCP `EXPOSE` in the final stage supplies the suggested port; dynamic/multiple ports still need
an operator's explicit choice. A Dockerfile inherited base's unrecorded exposed port is not guessed.

## Go

The Go recipe supports stable 1.25 and 1.26 toolchains. `build.goVersion` optionally pins a language
family or patch version. Without it, `.go-version` takes precedence over the `toolchain` and `go`
directives in `go.mod`; an older module language minimum uses the maintained 1.26 default. A selected
version cannot be older than the module requires. Resolved image digests, selected Go version and the
generated Dockerfile are recorded in build evidence. `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` prevents an unrecorded automatic
toolchain download inside the build. See the [Go toolchain rules](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain).

The default build compiles the one detected main package to `/out/app`. A custom build command executes
exactly as configured and must produce an executable there; this also allows code generation and an
explicit package choice for a repository with several mains. The historical detected `go build ./...`
command still executes, followed by the default output-producing build for compatibility. A custom start
command replaces the default `/app` entrypoint and runs inside the unprivileged runtime container.

This recipe uses `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Local non-test source importing `C`, unsupported source versions and
explicit CGO-enabling commands produce actionable planning/preparation refusals. Dependencies needing
CGO or more complex native-library/workspace arrangements require a Dockerfile; source scanning does
not certify all transitive dependencies. The dashboard's own required Go toolchain remains 1.26.8.

## Verification

`TestLiveDetectedFrameworkBuildAndServing` builds locked Next.js, Vite, SvelteKit Node/static, plain HTML,
Containerfile and Go fixtures through detection and the real artifact/runtime owners. It checks readiness
and served values without supplying build values at runtime; recipe fixtures also inspect logs, metadata
and saved image layers for private install credentials. The Go fixture proves generated code, custom
startup and the selected toolchain through its HTTP response. These local adapter journeys complement
the production-build browser gate; they do not constitute public provider/DNS/TLS or clean-VM acceptance.
